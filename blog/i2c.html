			<h1 id="i2c-basics">I2C Basics:</h1>
			<h2 id="note">Note:</h2>
			<p>This guide is purposefully simple and does not address some of the
				more intricate details of I2C (for now). For more information on I2C,
				please refer to the following: <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf">NXP UM10204
					I2C-bus specification and user manual</a>.</p>
			<p>Another thing worth noting is that traditionally, electrical
				engineers used “master/slave” to refer to I2C devices and these terms
				are often found in reference materials. To avoid confusion when reading,
				please note that this document is aligned with the latest I2C
				specification (I2C v.7) which updated these terms to be
				“controller/target”.</p>
			<h2 id="what-is-i2c">What is I2C?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Originally created in 1982 by Philips (now NXP semiconductor) as a
					simple 2-wire serial bus.</li>
				<li>Uses only one data and one clock line to allow a single controller
					to interface with multiple targets.</li>
				<li>I2C is very popular because it requires a lower amount of gates to
					implement compared to other similar protocols and only requires two
					pins. Both of which reduce cost.</li>
				<li>I2C is half duplex.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="protocol-details">Protocol Details:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The controller initializes communication and provides the clock
					signal (the SCL line is used to share the clock signal).</li>
				<li>I2C supports Controller-Target communication. Only two devices may
					use the bus at any given time.</li>
				<li>The clock signal effectively sets the data transfer rate for the
					system.
					<ul>
						<li>There is a maximum clock frequency for a given I2C mode but <em>no
								minimum clock speed</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The data line (SDA) is bidirectional which means that the controller
					can read <em>and</em> write to/from targets.</li>
				<li>Since I2C is a serial bus, data is transmitted one bit at a time in
					sync with the clock rate.</li>
				<li>Multiple controllers may share a bus. (Note: the full I2C
					specification covers arbitration and clock synchronization for this
					case.)</li>
				<li>Each device on the bus has a unique address, there are some reserved
					addresses for certain features.
					<ul>
						<li>Without the use of multiplexers, every device on the bus
							<em>must</em> have a unique address to prevent crowding.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The target can either be recieve only or act as an I2C
					transceiver.</li>
				<li>I2C hardware designs must account for capacitive loading on the bus
					from parasitic capacitance of the signal lines and input capacitance of
					devices on the bus.
					<ul>
						<li>It is recommended to not exceed 400pF of capacitive loading to keep
							rise times in an acceptable range.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<p>Pullup resistors pull SDA and SCL up to VDD. This is required for I2C
				since the protocol is designed to have open drain (CMOS) or open
				collector (BJT) devices on the bus. This way each device can easily pull
				the line low with one transistor instead of using two in a push pull
				configuration. Another benefit of this configuration is that the bus
				cannot be crowded by two devices trying to pull a line to opposite logic
				levels. This can result in indeterminate behavior and high currents
				flowing from high to low potential (see diagram).</p>

			<h2 id="basic-i2c-communication-frame-structure">Basic I2C Communication
				Frame Structure:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The controller must wait until the bus is free.
					<ul>
						<li>SDA and SCL must both be high for the bus to be free.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The controller then pulls the SDA line low while keeping SCL in the
					default state (high, no clocking).
					<ul>
						<li>This is known as the start condition and triggers all other devices
							on the bus to listen for their address to be called in the next
							step.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The controller starts providing the clock signal on SCL. All other
					devices on the bus will use this signal as a reference for when logic
					level changes on the SDA line are valid.
					<ul>
						<li>Apart from the start and stop conditions, no device on the bus may
							change the state of SDA unless SCL is pulled low.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The controller now sends a 7-bit address field.
					<ul>
						<li>10-bit addressing format:
							<ul>
								<li>10-bit addressing works by sending <code>0b1110XX</code> as the
									7-bit address (where <code>XX</code> are the two MSBs of the 10-bit
									address), a read/!write bit (see next list entry), an acknowledge bit
									field to see if there are any 10-bit devices on the bus, finally
									followed by the 8 remaining bits of the address and a second acknowledge
									field for the device at the specified 10-bit address.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The controller will then send the Read/!Write bit to signify whether
					the next operation will be a read request or a write operation.
					<ul>
						<li>Read is active high, write is active low.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>At this stage, the device that was addressed earlier (the target) is
					expected to acknowledge so the controller knows it’s on the bus and
					ready to communicate.
					<ul>
						<li>To acknowledge, the target will pull SDA low. This is known as an
							“ACK bit”.</li>
						<li>If no device acknowledges the bus will continue to be pulled high by
							the pullup resistors since the controller released the line. This is
							known as an “NACK bit” (No Acknowledge).</li>
						<li><strong><em>NOTE: All ACK/NACK signals must be sent by a
									receiver.</em></strong></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If the receiver sent an ACK the data transfer process may follow.
					<ul>
						<li>Otherwise the operation is canceled.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Data transfer is done in an unlimited sequence of 8-bit words.
					<ul>
						<li>After every 8-bit frame, the receiving device is expected to send an
							ACK signal to ensure synchronization and that data is still making it to
							the receiving device.</li>
						<li>It is standard procedure for most devices to cancel data
							transmission if an NACK is sent at this stage but the specification
							allows for other scenarios. The datasheet of a device should be
							consulted to determine its behavior since a NACK signal may also
							represent other things (access delay, an interrupt is being serviced,
							etc).</li>
						<li>Some devices use a repeated start condition and will repeat the
							control byte to signify continued data transfer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When the data transfer is finished, the controller transitions SDA
					from low to high while holding SCL high. This is called the stop
					condition and tells other devices that the bus is now free.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a system with multiple controllers, a controller may use a general
				call to identify themselves to other devices on the bus (See <a href="#reserved-addresses">Reserved
					Addresses</a> and section 3.1.13 of
				the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf">I2C
					spec NXP UM10204</a>).</p>

			<p>There are still some concepts in I2C that still need to be covered
				and will probably be added later. In the interim if you need more
